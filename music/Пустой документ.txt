Electronics in Industry.

Ex 3.
1. Electronics is the science or practice of using electricity in devices similar to transistors and radio tubes so as to get results not possible with ordinary electrical equipment.
2. If a device passes its stream of electrons through internal space, or through the junction where certain difÂ­ferent metals meet, the device is called electronic.
3. Most of these familiar equipments serve to carry or give information; so communication early was a main purpose of electronics and still holds interest of many workers and students in this field.
4. Meanwhile industry seeking faster and more accurate methods of production has adapted electronic equipment to its own needs.

Electronics is the science or practice of using electricity in devices similar to transistors and radio tubes so as to get results not possible with ordinary electrical equipment. Without electronics there might be no radio, television, sound pictures or long-distance telephone calls. Much of the success of electronics depends on the methods used to obtain an electric signal that can be used to stimulate the electronic device into action. The electronic circuit can be made to detect such a signal, increase its strength and put it to useful work.

Electronics is very useful in production. It allows you to automate heavy and complex processes.
